If you have two features that have different ranges (say one feature from 1-100, other vary from 5-300), you will need to scale them so they have the same range of values.\n","\n","More specifically, normalization is a preferrable scaling technique when the data at hand does not have a normal or gaussian distribution. If the data's distribution is gaussian, standardization is a preferrable scaling technique. If you don't know the distribution of the data, still, normalization is a good choice at first.\n","\n","With that said, when the ML algorithm of choice is either neural network or K-Nearest
