The company wants to figure out what went wrong.\n","\n","`Approach`:\n","\n","We are concerned about determining the driver variable for show viewership. We are interested in predicting the key driver variables and their impact rather than forcasting the results.\n","\n","What could be potential reasons for the decline in viewershp?\n","\n","The potential reasons could be:\n","\n","- Decline in the number of people coming to the platform\n","- Fewer people watching the video\n","- A Decrease in marketing spend?\n","- Competitive shows, e.g. cricket/ IPL\n","- Special holidays\n","- Twist in the story\n","\n","`Data Description`:\n","- Views_show : Number of times the show was viewed\n","- Visitors : Number of visitors who browsed the platform, but not necessarily watched a video.\n","- Views_platform : Number of times a video was viewed on the platform\n","- Ad_impression : Proxy for marketing budget. Represents number of impressions generated by ads\n","- Cricket_match_india: If a cricket match was being played. 1 indicates match on a given day, 0 indicates there wasn't\n","- Character_A : Describes presence of Character A. 1 indicates character A was in the episode, 0 indicates they weren't."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"2tvZT1XrEGk2"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","
